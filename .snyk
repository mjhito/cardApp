    rule_code: "CallExpression< \"myOwnSanitizer\">\n# This example finds all calls to library functions named 'login' (among others, the Java class\n# sun.net.ftp.impl.FtpClient has such a method to log into an FTP server). This can be useful to locate code that\n# handles user credentials.\n# Note that calls to functions defined in your own code usually cannot be looked up using this template, because\n# the analysis engine inlines such calls if possible."
