      # This example finds all calls to library functions named 'login' (among
      others, the Java class

      # sun.net.ftp.impl.FtpClient has such a method to log into an FTP server).
      This can be useful to locate code that

      # handles user credentials.

      # Note that calls to functions defined in your own code usually cannot be
      looked up using this template, because

      # the analysis engine inlines such calls if possible.
